# 🤔 What is Lixo.exe?
Lixo.exe is a small trojan made in C++ and 8086 Assembly. In general, it modifies some registry keys, create copies of it self to critical Windows directories, play some bytebeats, show some GDI-Effects, overwrites the bootsector (MBR) to 10 Payloads made in ASM, and many other things.
