# ü§î What is Lixo.exe?
Lixo.exe is a small trojan made in C++ and 8086 Assembly for <b>WINDOWS XP</b>. In general, it modifies some registry keys, create copies of itself to critical Windows directories, play some bytebeats, show some GDI-Effects, overwrites the bootsector (MBR) to 10 Payloads made in ASM, and many other things. By the way, this is my 3rd GDI-Trojan and probably the last one...

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important!!!
This is a <b>potentially harmful program</b> that can cause your <b>system's death</b> & <b>data loss</b>. This software also displays flashing lights and plays loud sounds, so if you have a photosensitive disease like epilepsy, don't run this or watch any video about it for your security.

By running this program, you accept full responsibility for any damages that may occur. So, the creator (ArTic a.k.a JhoPro) will not be responsible for anything caused by this software. By the way, this was created for educational and entertainment purposes, consequently, don't use it to do malicious acts like sharing with a friend.

If you also see a bug, report to me in some way, contact: ArTicüåä#1892

# ü§î Execution tip
I forgot talking this before, but when I watched back some videos about Lixo.exe, I realized how badly is the optimization... So, I recommend you running it in a decreased resolution to get a really cool experience and not laggy. Thanks for reading it!

# üíä What is the difference about LixoDestructive and LixoSafe?
As the name says, LixoDestructive is the version that includes the destruction. This version is recommended just for people that uses Virtual Machine or a Sandbox.    

Otherwise, LixoSafe is the version that doesn't include the destruction (TOTALLY HARMLESS). So it won't overwrite the MBR, create copies of itself and modify and create registry keys. By the way, you don't need to run it on a Virtual Machine or a Sandbox. Just choose your preference...

# ü§° For Skidders
Well, I've already seen Pankoza skidding this trojan, and I'm really sad about it... So, a basic explaining, I made this trojan Open Source to make my subscribers look how it's made a GDI-Trojan and to make people learn GDI basics, NOT TO OPEN DOOR FOR CODE SKIDDERS!!!

However, if you want to use a part of this code (e.g Payload's threading system, RGBQUAD's system or System's manipulation), I able you to use it, but you need to <b>CREDIT ME</b>. By the way, if you want to use the HSL or the MBR Overwritter, <b>credit Wipet or SleepMod</b>, not me!!

Otherwise, if you're about to skid any GDI EFFECT of this trojan, I (ArTic/JhoPro) don't able you! And know that you're infringing this software license. 
<b>Create your own effects and I create mine, fine?</b>
