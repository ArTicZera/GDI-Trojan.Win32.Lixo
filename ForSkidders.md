# 🤡 For Skidders
Well, I've already seen Pankoza skidding this trojan, and I'm really sad about it... So, a basic explaining, I made this trojan Open Source to make my subscribers look how it's made a GDI-Trojan and to make people learn GDI basics, NOT TO OPEN DOOR FOR CODE SKIDDERS!!!

However, if you want to use a part of this code (e.g Payload's threading system, RGBQUAD's system or System's manipulation), I able you to use it, but you need to <b>CREDIT ME</b>. By the way, if you want to use the HSL or the MBR Overwritter, <b>credit Wipet or SleepMod</b>, not me!!

Otherwise, if you're about to skid any GDI EFFECT of this trojan, I (ArTic/JhoPro) don't able you! And know that you're infringing this software license. 

<b>Create your own effects and I create mine, fine?</b>
